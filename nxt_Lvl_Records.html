                <p>Nxt Lvl Records is a music label started in 2019 by John Blaze, and aimed to help artist just
                    starting
                    their
                    careers in music. It provided them with a structure and provided assistance with everything from
                    single
                    and
                    album covers ers, music videos, studio time, and registration platforms to get artist paid.
                    <br>
                    It has worked with artist across the country as well as some overseas artist. Nxt Lvl Records has
                    always
                    believed that artist should be able to work on the art and not have to worry about all the backend
                    of
                    the
                    music busniess.
                    <br>
                    Although this is just a stepping stone for most artist, even after the seperation from the label,
                    artist
                    continue to grow and excel in the music industry never forgetting where they started out.
